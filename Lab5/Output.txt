 email address identifies email box to which messages delivered. While early messaging systems used variety of formats for addressing, today, email addresses follow set of specific rules originally standardized by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  1980s, and updated by RFC 5322 and RFC 6854. email address, such as john.smith@example.com, is made up from local-part,  symbol@, and domain name. Although standard requires local part to be case-sensitive, it also urges that receiving hosts deliver messages case-independent manner, e.g., that mail system domain example.com treat John.Smith as equivalent to john.smith; some mail systems even treat them as equivalent to johnsmith. Mail systems often limit users' choice of name to subset of technically permitted characters. general format of email address is local-part@domain. And specific example is jsmith@example.com. Thus,  address consists of two principal parts,  username and domain name.  domain name is used to transport mail message to host of recipient's mail system.
